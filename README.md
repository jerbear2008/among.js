# among.js
## About
~~Please understand my broken English, I'm not very good at [English](https://www.deepl.com/translator) lmao~~
among.js is a npm package to monitor memory for [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us).

## Installation
âš  This package isn't installed if the system hasn't the file that [memoryjs](https://github.com/Rob--/memoryjs) need.
```
npm install among.js
```
It'll work fine on **Windows 64bit** but by others system, it won't be not working.
